        <h2 class="center top-pad">What is Brightfruit?</h2>
        <p>Brightfruit is a team of students and educators from the University of Michigan and the surrounding Ann Arbor area, working to bring experiential Entrepreneurship programs to middle and high school students. Our curriculum was developed by entrepreneurs, faculty and students of the University of Michigan, and local Ann Arbor public and private school teachers. This collaboration has yielded an Entrepreneurship curriculum that provides an introduction to Entrepreneurship through actually engaging in Entrepreneurship, and develops essential technical and interpersonal skills such as familiarity with the iterative framework for product and business development, customer and problem discovery, solution development, and service leadership.</p>
        <p class="bottom-pad">We currently provide services that help middle and high schools set up and operate an Entrepreneurship program at their academic institutions. Our services range from curriculum development to teacher and mentor training, guest speaker scheduling, consultation sessions, and in-class instruction support.</p>
