        <h3>How do students problem-solve when the reality and complexity of problems extend so far beyond the prompts within textbooks?</h3>
        <p>Education research shows that the over-reliance on structure in the traditional classroom settings can stifle creativity and the ability to understand big-picture, complex problem spaces. It does not effectively prepare students to work outside of that class structure, in ambiguous environments where there may not be clear paths to success. How do students problem-solve when the reality and complexity of problems extend so far beyond the prompts within textbooks?</p>
        <p class="bottom-pad">Our Entrepreneurship Programs create a new kind of immersive environment for learning, taking students out of their usual level of structure and challenging them to interact with outside stakeholders and resources, all while working in teams and taking ownership of their own projects and decisions. At the end of the workshop series, students will be equipped with the tools and framework that will allow them to effectively engage with any problem they find compelling and meaningful.</p>
