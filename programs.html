      <h2 class="showcase top-pad project-title">Entrepreneurship Pilot Course at Ann Arbor Open School</h2>
      <p class="showcase project-description">Brightfruit helped Ann Arbor Open School set up and operate their first Entrepreneurship elective course. Brightfruit provided Ann Arbor Open School with the information needed to get the elective course approved by the district, as well as the curriculum, detailed lesson plans, project details, instructor mentoring, consultation, and in-class instruction support. Brightfruit also assisted in scheduling guest speakers such as local entrepreneur Sandy Ryder of Wild Swan Theatre Company, and in reserving a space for students to sell their final product at a nearby local foods grocery store and cafe Argus Farm Stop.</p>

        <h2 class="top-pad">Future Projects</h2>
        <p>Our future projects are plans we have for expansion. We are currently in conversation with Ann Arbor Public School District about expanding our in-school and after-school services to other schools in the Ann Arbor area such as Forsythe Middle School, Community High School, Pioneer High School, and Skyline High School. We are also in the process of discussing a potential partnership with Clonlara Schools to help develop a digitla entrepreneurship curriculum that will be integrated into their network of distance-learning and homeschooled students, as well as mentors.</p>
        <p class="bottom-pad">We are excited about our work, and we hope that you are too. We are always looking for new partners to help us expand our services and reach more students. If you are interested in what we do, and how we can help you get started on implementing our experiential, project-based Entrepreneurship curriculum, <a href="contact.html">send us a message!</a> We would love to hear from you.</p>
